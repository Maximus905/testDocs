Welcome to the th2-documentation wiki!


**what is th2?**

The th2 toolkit is designed to enable efficient machine learning (ML)- driven testing forcomplex distributed transaction processing systems, such as securities trading systems andexchanges, banking, brokerage, post-trade (e.g. clearing, settlement, custody), andpayments platforms.

th2 can withstand heavy testing loads, improving test coverage, system quality, andresilience. This is complemented by a range of enhanced data capabilities including fasterdata processing and unified storage of test results. This provides the ability to perform theanalysis of massive amounts of generated test evidence, ensuring regulatory compliance.

th2 is a Kubernetes-driven microservices solution. It operates by leveraging a technologystack with an open interface, allowing users to adopt digital technology such as the cloudand distributed ledger technology (DLT). It can integrate with a wide range of existing testtools, frameworks, and network protocols.

**what is th2 for?**

Users of th2, such as software development engineers in test (SDET) professionals whocan work equally and effectively as programmers, testers and data analysts - , will be able toexecute sophisticated test algorithms, collect and process distributed test data (e.g. for MLmachine learning purposes), perform model-based testing, and analyse the behaviour of thesystems under test. th2 microservices design allows implementing a large variety ofautomated testing techniques and efficiently combining them to deal with very complex testcases and scenarios.
