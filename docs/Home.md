## **th2 - NEXT GENERATION SOFTWARE TESTING FRAMEWORK**

![](img/th2_logo_2.png) [**th2 - GETTING STARTED!**](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-documentation/wiki/Getting-Started)

# **what is th2?**

The th2 toolkit is designed to enable efficient machine learning (ML)- driven testing for complex distributed transaction processing systems, such as securities trading systems andexchanges, banking, brokerage, post-trade (e.g. clearing, settlement, custody), and payments platforms.

th2 can withstand heavy testing loads, improving test coverage, system quality, and resilience. This is complemented by a range of enhanced data capabilities including faster data processing and unified storage of test results. This provides the ability to perform the analysis of massive amounts of generated test evidence, ensuring regulatory compliance.

th2 is a Kubernetes-driven microservices solution. It operates by leveraging a technology stack with an open interface, allowing users to adopt digital technology such as the cloud and distributed ledger technology (DLT). It can integrate with a wide range of existing testtools, frameworks, and network protocols.

# **what is th2 for?**

Users of th2, such as software development engineers in test (SDET) professionals whocan work equally and effectively as programmers, testers and data analysts - , will be able to execute sophisticated test algorithms, collect and process distributed test data (e.g. for machine learning purposes), perform model-based testing, and analyse the behaviour of the systems under test. 

th2 microservices design allows implementing a large variety of automated testing techniques and efficiently combining them to deal with very complex test cases and scenarios.
